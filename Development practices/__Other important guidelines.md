## Do!
* [Check the return value of **#save**, otherwise use **#save!**](http://rails-bestpractices.com/posts/2012/11/02/check-the-return-value-of-save-otherwise-use-save) The same goes for #create, #update and #destroy.
* Mirror model validations to database constraints and defaults as much as possible.
* Validate the associated `belongs_to` object (`user`), not the database column (`user_id`).
* All non-actions controller methods should be **private**.
* Use the user's name in the `From` header and email in the `Reply-To` when [**delivering an email on behalf of the app's users**]( http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/3215611590/recipe-delivering-email-on-behalf-of-users)


## Don't!
* Never use `has_and_belongs_to_many`â€”use `has_many :through` instead. The first one has unexpected hidden behaviors and, if you find out that you need an extra column in the intermediate table, converting it to the second macro requires a fair amount of work.
* [**Never rescue the Exception class**](http://rails-bestpractices.com/posts/2012/11/01/don-t-rescue-exception-rescue-standarderror/)
* Don't change a migration after it's been merged into master if the desired change can be solved with another migration.
* Don't reference a model class directly from a view.
* Don't use instance variables in partials. Pass local variables to partials from view templates.
* Don't use before_actions for setting instance variables. Use them only for changing the application flow, such as redirecting if a user is not authenticated.
* Avoid the `:except` option in routes. Use the `:only` option to explicitly state exposed routes.


## Naming
* Name date columns with `_on` suffixes.
* Name datetime columns with `_at` suffixes.
* Name time columns (referring to a time of day with no date) with `_time` suffixes.
* Name initializers for their gem name.


## Organization
* Order ActiveRecord associations above ActiveRecord validations.
* Order i18n translations alphabetically by key name.
