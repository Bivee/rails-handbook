Project requirements are prone to changes. Even with a good, stable API design, the new requirement might force the API to change as well, which breaks client code unless it's adapted. Sometimes, it's not possible for all clients to adopt the change (like mobile applications which depend on users to update them), but we still have to push the change to other clients. At that point, we have to backward support one version of an endpoint and simultaneously release a new one. This is called versioning.

In technical terms, API versioning is a strategy for serving the same resource in multiple, incompatible formats. We will define what "incompatible" means later on.

## To version, or not to version

### No breaking changes

To give an example of a non-breaking change, imagine you are serving an endpoint which returns country data:

```json
// GET api/v1/countries/hr
{
  "name": "Croatia",
  "code": "HR" // alpha2 code
}
```

This endpoint fulfills all needs â€” for the time being. After a while, a new requirement is to serialize alpha-3 country code along with the existing alpha-2 code. You might be tempted to just add a new key `alpha_3_code` to the response, but why should `code` by default imply alpha-2 code? Now that you have to serialize multiple country codes, wouldn't it make more sense to have keys `alpha_2_code` and `alpha_3_code` so it's immediately obvious what each of them represents?

If the answer to that question is affirmative, and you know that some clients depend on the `code` key and that they won't be able to rename it to `alpha_2_code` in a timely fashion, but you still want to add the new alpha-3 code, then you could add 2 new attributes alongside the existing ones and communicate the deprecation to the API consumers.

```json
// GET api/v1/countries/hr
{
  "name": "Croatia",
  "code": "HR", // deprecated
  "alpha_2_code": "HR",
  "alpha_3_code": "HRV"
}
```

*Side note*: notice that if the key for alpha-2 code was named `alpha_2_code` from the start, a change like the mentioned one wouldn't be necessary. That is, the only change would be the addition of a new key `alpha_3_code`, which is not breaking anything. This is one of the reasons why it's important to carefully think about API design and naming in particular.

### Breaking changes

Let's continue using the same example with countries, but this time we'll introduce a breaking change. If you take a closer look at the response, you might notice we lack a way to paginate the resources.

```json
// GET api/v1/countries
[
  {
    "name": "Croatia",
    "alpha_2_code": "HR",
    "alpha_3_code": "HRV"
  },
  {
    "name": "Germany",
    "alpha_2_code": "DE",
    "alpha_3_code": "DEU"
  }
]
```

The usual way is via a new object, called `meta`, where we can keep some calculated properties the frontend might use, but since we only have an array of country objects, there's no way to distinguish a new object that contains some other stuff, so the response will have to be changed to:

```json
{
  "results": [
    // here come our country objects
  ],
  "meta": {
    "current_page": 1,
    "next_page": 2,
    "total_pages": 20,
    "total_count": 150
  }
}
```

The problem is that we can't introduce this modification to the existing endpoint `api/v1/countries`, so we'll have to leave it as is, and suffer the consequences of having an unpaginated endpoint with potentially many objects. Luckily, we can open a new endpoint `api/v2/countries` and notify our API consumers that the `v1` endpoint is deprecated and will be dropped in the future.

In short, here are the usual operations upon an existing endpoint and whether they are breaking or not:

- adding a new attribute - no break
- renaming an attribute - break
- removing an attribute - break
- changing the value type for an attribute - break
- changing the format or structure (eg: JSON to GraphQL) - break

## How to version

There are a number of strategies for API versioning. This is still a widely discussed and contentious topic, but this chapter won't go into details (if you're interested, see [this blog post](https://www.troyhunt.com/your-api-versioning-is-wrong-which-is/)). Rather, we'll propose a versioning strategy which works for us.

We version APIs by adding a version number in the URL (prefixed with `v`). For example, an API for retrieving countries might have endpoints `/api/v1/countries` and `/api/v2/countries`.

We include the version in APIs *from the beginning*, starting with `v1`. This choice is a pragmatic one even if you'll never have to release a second version. The cost of adding a version to the URL initially is imperceptible and once it's set up, you don't have to think about it anymore. Adding new versions is also easy because you won't have to change/refactor code from version `v1` in order to support the new version.

In Rails, this kind of versioning has the following structure in routes:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
namespace :api do
  namespace :v1 do
    resource :countries
  end

  namespace :v2 do
    resource :countries
  end
end
```

Controllers are then also namespaced under the API version: `Api::V1::CountriesController` for `/api/v1/countries`, and `Api::V2::CountriesController` for `/api/v2/countries`. Maintain this consistency with other abstractions as well: serializers, policies, specs, documentation or any custom-made constructs.
